A Network Management Application
We need a management application to manage all registered members in an automated manner, the application should be able to send reminders to partners based on their specified time of giving every month, quarter and every year, send acknowledgement when they have made donations, send birthday greetings on Partnerâ€™s birthday, send daily scriptures to all registered partners and much more. The management applicated should have an integrated payment gateway.
